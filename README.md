# Threat Hunt Report: Unauthorized Persistence & Backdoor Creation
- [Scenario Creation](https://github.com/Goodka7/Threat-Hunting-Persistence-/blob/main/resources/Threat-Hunt-Event(Persistence).md)

## Platforms and Languages Leveraged
- Linux (Ubuntu 22.04) Virtual Machines (Microsoft Azure)
- EDR Platform: Microsoft Defender for Endpoint
- Kusto Query Language (KQL)
- Bash

## Scenario

Management has raised concerns about a soon-to-be-terminated employee potentially creating unauthorized backdoors and persistence mechanisms to maintain illicit access to company systems. Suspicious activity has been detected on the machine `thlinux.p2zfvso05mlezjev3ck4vqd3kd.cx.internal.cloudapp.net`, where security teams suspect that multiple persistence techniques may have been deployed to retain unauthorized administrative control.

The objective is to identify and analyze unauthorized persistence mechanisms, detect Indicators of Compromise (IOCs), and assess the extent of the security breach. Immediate action will be taken to address any identified threats.

### High-Level IoC Discovery Plan

- **Check `DeviceFileEvents`** for modifications to `~/.ssh/authorized_keys`, systemd service files, and SUID binaries.
- **Check `DeviceProcessEvents`** for suspicious executions, including unauthorized system service modifications and Trojanized commands.
- **Check `DeviceLogonEvents`** for unusual remote login activity.

---

## Steps Taken

### 1. Searched the `DeviceProcessEvents` Table

Identify unauthorized privilege escalation attempts and backdoor persistence through SUID manipulation.

At **Feb 2, 2025 1:33:49 PM**, the user **"baddog"** executed the following command on the device **"thlinux.p2zfvso05mlezjev3ck4vqd3kd.cx.internal.cloudapp.net"**:
```
sh -c 'cat /proc/sys/kernel/random/uuid | awk -F- '{print $1$2$3$4$5}''
```

This command is commonly used to generate a unique identifier, possibly as part of a script used to automate privilege escalation or persistence.

At **Feb 2, 2025 3:54:17 PM**, the user **"baddog"** executed the following command on the device **"thlinux.p2zfvso05mlezjev3ck4vqd3kd.cx.internal.cloudapp.net"**:
```
sudo chown root:root /tmp/rootbash
```

Shortly after, at 3:55:22 PM, the user set the SUID permission to ensure persistent root access:
```
sudo chmod u+s /tmp/rootbash
```

Finally, at Feb 2, 2025 3:56:18 PM, the attacker executed:
```
/tmp/rootbash -p
```

This confirms the successful execution of the backdoor, allowing privilege escalation to root.

**Query used to locate events:**

```kql
DeviceProcessEvents
| where DeviceName == "thlinux.p2zfvso05mlezjev3ck4vqd3kd.cx.internal.cloudapp.net"
| where ProcessCommandLine contains "authorized_keys" or ProcessCommandLine contains "echo" or ProcessCommandLine contains "cat"
| project Timestamp, DeviceName, ActionType, ProcessCommandLine

DeviceProcessEvents
| where DeviceName == "thlinux.p2zfvso05mlezjev3ck4vqd3kd.cx.internal.cloudapp.net"
| where ProcessCommandLine contains "/tmp/rootbash"
| project Timestamp, DeviceName, AccountName, ActionType, ProcessCommandLine
```

---

### 2. Searched the `DeviceLogonEvents` Table

Searched for any `AccountName` that was not "baddog" to detect unauthorized SSH logins.

At **Feb 2, 2025 3:15:01 PM**, the user **"root"** logged into the device **"thlinux.p2zfvso05mlezjev3ck4vqd3kd.cx.internal.cloudapp.net"** via **Network logon type**, indicating a remote SSH connection.

This suggests that a backdoor mechanism was used to gain unauthorized root access.

**Query used to locate event:**

```kql
DeviceLogonEvents
| where DeviceName == "thlinux.p2zfvso05mlezjev3ck4vqd3kd.cx.internal.cloudapp.net"
| where AccountName != "baddog"  // Look for unexpected SSH logins
| where LogonType in ("RemoteInteractive", "Network")
| project Timestamp, DeviceName, AccountName, RemoteIP, LogonType
```

---

### 3. Searched the `DeviceProcessEvents` Table

Detect the creation or execution of a malicious systemd service for persistence.

At **Feb 2, 2025 3:12:10 PM**, the user **"baddog"** executed the following command on the device **"thlinux.p2zfvso05mlezjev3ck4vqd3kd.cx.internal.cloudapp.net"**:
```
sudo systemctl start malicious.service
```

This action started a malicious systemd service designed to maintain persistent access to the system.

The service was created earlier by the user with the following command:
```
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/malicious.service
```

This confirms that the systemd service malicious.service was set up as a means of ensuring the attacker could regain access if necessary.


**Query used to locate events:**

```kql
DeviceProcessEvents
| where DeviceName == "thlinux.p2zfvso05mlezjev3ck4vqd3kd.cx.internal.cloudapp.net"
| where ProcessCommandLine contains "malicious.service"
| project Timestamp, DeviceName, ActionType, ProcessCommandLine
```

---

### 4. Searched the `DeviceProcessEvents` Table

Detect the execution of a Trojanized script (`ls`) used to maintain unauthorized access.

At **Feb 2, 2025 4:00:13 PM**, the user **"baddog"** executed the following command on the device **"thlinux.p2zfvso05mlezjev3ck4vqd3kd.cx.internal.cloudapp.net"**:
```
~/.local/bin/ls
```
This command runs a Trojanized version of the `ls` utility, which was replaced by a script that attempts to establish a reverse shell connection back to the attacker's machine. This action indicates the attempt to maintain access by running malicious scripts under the guise of a common administrative command.

**Query used to locate events:**

```kql
// Detect execution of Trojanized 'ls' command
DeviceProcessEvents
| where DeviceName == "thlinux.p2zfvso05mlezjev3ck4vqd3kd.cx.internal.cloudapp.net"
| where ProcessCommandLine contains "/home/baddog/.local/bin/ls"
| project Timestamp, DeviceName, AccountName, ActionType, ProcessCommandLine 
```

## Summary

The user "baddog" on the device "thlinux.p2zfvso05mlezjev3ck4vqd3kd.cx.internal.cloudapp.net" took deliberate actions to establish persistence and gain unauthorized root access. Initially, the attacker created a malicious backdoor binary (`/tmp/rootbash`) and modified its ownership to `root`. Following this, the attacker set the SUID permission on the binary, allowing any user to execute it with root privileges, effectively escalating their access. The attacker then executed the backdoor to confirm the privilege escalation.

To ensure persistent access, the attacker created and enabled a **malicious systemd service** (`malicious.service`) which would automatically start the backdoor on system boot. Additionally, a **Trojanized `ls` command** was placed in the user's home directory (`~/.local/bin/ls`), which was executed to establish a reverse shell connection back to the attacker's machine.

These actions suggest that the user "baddog" was attempting to establish a **backdoor and maintain persistent root access** on the system, bypassing security controls and potentially preparing for further unauthorized activities.

---

## Response Taken

Unauthorized root access and backdoor activities were confirmed on the endpoint **"thlinux.p2zfvso05mlezjev3ck4vqd3kd.cx.internal.cloudapp.net"** by the user **"baddog"**. 

The device was isolated and the user's direct manager was notified. I recommend the backdoor and associated persistence mechanisms being disabled. Further investigation and remediation are underway to assess any potential data exfiltration or other malicious actions.
