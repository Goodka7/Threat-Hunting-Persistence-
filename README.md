# Threat Hunt Report: Unauthorized Persistence & Backdoor Creation

## Platforms and Languages Leveraged
- Linux (Ubuntu 22.04) Virtual Machines (Microsoft Azure)
- EDR Platform: Microsoft Defender for Endpoint
- Kusto Query Language (KQL)
- Bash

## Scenario

Management has raised concerns about a soon-to-be-terminated employee potentially creating unauthorized backdoors and persistence mechanisms to maintain illicit access to company systems. Suspicious activity has been detected on the machine `thlinux.p2zfvso05mlezjev3ck4vqd3kd.cx.internal.cloudapp.net`, where security teams suspect that multiple persistence techniques may have been deployed to retain unauthorized administrative control.

The objective is to identify and analyze unauthorized persistence mechanisms, detect Indicators of Compromise (IOCs), and assess the extent of the security breach. Immediate action will be taken to address any identified threats.

### High-Level IoC Discovery Plan

- **Check `DeviceFileEvents`** for modifications to `~/.ssh/authorized_keys`, systemd service files, and SUID binaries.
- **Check `DeviceProcessEvents`** for suspicious executions, including unauthorized system service modifications and Trojanized commands.
- **Check `DeviceLogonEvents`** for unusual remote login activity.

---

## Steps Taken

### 1. Searched the `DeviceProcessEvents` Table for SUID Backdoor Creation & Execution

Identify unauthorized privilege escalation attempts and backdoor persistence through SUID manipulation.

At **Feb 2, 2025 1:33:49 PM**, the user **"baddog"** executed the following command on the device **"thlinux.p2zfvso05mlezjev3ck4vqd3kd.cx.internal.cloudapp.net"**:
```
sh -c 'cat /proc/sys/kernel/random/uuid | awk -F- '{print $1$2$3$4$5}''
```

This command is commonly used to generate a unique identifier, possibly as part of a script used to automate privilege escalation or persistence.

At **Feb 2, 2025 3:54:17 PM**, the user **"baddog"** executed the following command on the device **"thlinux.p2zfvso05mlezjev3ck4vqd3kd.cx.internal.cloudapp.net"**:
```
sudo chown root:root /tmp/rootbash
```

Shortly after, at 3:55:22 PM, the user set the SUID permission to ensure persistent root access:
```
sudo chmod u+s /tmp/rootbash
```

Finally, at Feb 2, 2025 3:56:18 PM, the attacker executed:
```
/tmp/rootbash -p
```

This confirms the successful execution of the backdoor, allowing privilege escalation to root.

**Query used to locate events:**

```kql
DeviceProcessEvents
| where DeviceName == "thlinux.p2zfvso05mlezjev3ck4vqd3kd.cx.internal.cloudapp.net"
| where ProcessCommandLine contains "authorized_keys" or ProcessCommandLine contains "echo" or ProcessCommandLine contains "cat"
| project Timestamp, DeviceName, ActionType, ProcessCommandLine

DeviceProcessEvents
| where DeviceName == "thlinux.p2zfvso05mlezjev3ck4vqd3kd.cx.internal.cloudapp.net"
| where ProcessCommandLine contains "/tmp/rootbash"
| project Timestamp, DeviceName, AccountName, ActionType, ProcessCommandLine
```

---

### 2. Searched the `DeviceLogonEvents` Table

Searched for any `AccountName` that was not "baddog" to detect unauthorized SSH logins.

At **Feb 2, 2025 3:15:01 PM**, the user **"root"** logged into the device **"thlinux.p2zfvso05mlezjev3ck4vqd3kd.cx.internal.cloudapp.net"** via **Network logon type**, indicating a remote SSH connection.

This suggests that a backdoor mechanism was used to gain unauthorized root access.

**Query used to locate event:**

```kql
DeviceLogonEvents
| where DeviceName == "thlinux.p2zfvso05mlezjev3ck4vqd3kd.cx.internal.cloudapp.net"
| where AccountName != "baddog"  // Look for unexpected SSH logins
| where LogonType in ("RemoteInteractive", "Network")
| project Timestamp, DeviceName, AccountName, RemoteIP, LogonType
```

---

### 3. Searched the `DeviceProcessEvents` Table for Malicious Systemd Service Execution

**Objective:** Detect the creation or execution of a malicious systemd service for persistence.

At **Feb 2, 2025 3:12:10 PM**, the user **"baddog"** executed the following command on the device **"thlinux.p2zfvso05mlezjev3ck4vqd3kd.cx.internal.cloudapp.net"**:
```
sudo systemctl start malicious.service
```

This action started a malicious systemd service designed to maintain persistent access to the system.

The service was created earlier by the user with the following command:
```
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/malicious.service
```

This confirms that the systemd service malicious.service was set up as a means of ensuring the attacker could regain access if necessary.


**Query used to locate events:**

```kql
DeviceProcessEvents
| where DeviceName == "thlinux.p2zfvso05mlezjev3ck4vqd3kd.cx.internal.cloudapp.net"
| where ProcessCommandLine contains "malicious.service"
| project Timestamp, DeviceName, ActionType, ProcessCommandLine
```

### 4. Searched the `DeviceNetworkEvents` Table for TOR Network Connections

Searched for any indication the TOR browser was used to establish a connection using any of the known TOR ports. The results showed user “labuser” did indeed use tor to connect to an url.

At 3:43:03 PM on January 20, 2025, a successful connection was made by the user "labuser" from the device "hardmodevm" to the remote IP address 45.21.116.144 on port 9001. The connection was made using the file "tor.exe," and the remote URL accessed was https://www.35yt53tip6fr4hoov4a.com.


**Query used to locate events:**

```kql
DeviceNetworkEvents
| where DeviceName  == "hardmodevm"
| where InitiatingProcessAccountName == "labuser"
| where RemotePort in ("9001", "9030", "9040", "9050", "9051", "9150", "80", "443")  
| project Timestamp, DeviceName, InitiatingProcessAccountName, ActionType, RemoteIP, RemotePort, RemoteUrl, InitiatingProcessFileName, InitiatingProcessFolderPath  
| order by Timestamp desc
```

## Summary

The user "labuser" on the device "hardmodevm" installed and used the Tor Browser, taking actions that raised concerns. First, "labuser" silently initiated the installation of the Tor Browser through a PowerShell command. After the installation, they created the "tor.exe" file and executed it, which started the Tor service with specific configurations. Additionally, multiple instances of "firefox.exe" associated with the Tor Browser were launched, and the user successfully connected to the Tor network, accessing a remote IP and URL, suggesting the use of Tor for anonymous browsing. Furthermore, a folder (tor-shopping-list) containing several .txt and .json files was created, holding several files with names indicating potential illicit activity. These actions suggest that the user may have been engaging in suspicious or unauthorized activities using the Tor network.

---

## Response Taken

TOR usage was confirmed on the endpoint `hardmodevm` by the user `labuser`. The device was isolated, and the user's direct manager was notified.
